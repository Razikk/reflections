How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	By using "git status" to see the files that are in the staging area, "git diff" to see the difference between the staged and working directory files and "git diff --staged" to see the difference between the staged files and the last committed files in the branch.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	
	When creating an experimental build. When creating a different version, e.g. for another operating system. When creating a personal build for your own special uses.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	By showing each commit's parent and whether commit's are reachable from one another.
