When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with other developers and/or working on the same project from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To decide what changes you want to pull so that your current work doesn't get wiped out, or features broken, or unwanted features added.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is different from a clone in that it exists only on Github and can refer back to the original repository. Clones are only on local machines. Branches are, whether temporarily or permanent, off-shoots of a repository that refer back to the specific commit they were created from.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So that changes can be compared to it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Upload files to a dropbox or private server.
    Not needing to know the ins and outs of Git/Github and memorizing a bunch of commands.
    Resolving conflicts with changed files.
    Working on a project with many people, especially if not in constant contact with those people.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
